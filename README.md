# CoolBoot
The bootloader of the gods

## how to boot a kernel image
go to the coolboot.sys file
add a line with the following code:
  KERNEL_FILE=path to/kernel image/kernelname;
 do not use quotes in the file name, spaces are supported natively
 if you are stuck, use the coolboot.sys file in the CoolOS repository which contains the defaults used by CoolOS
